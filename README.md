The TFL
=======
_The Truly Free License_

### Why?

Quite simply, there is a common misconception among the gnu faitheful that they have a right to
appropriate code from open source licenses and lock it down under the more restrictive GPL.  Specifically
advocates of the GPL have proclaimed publically the right to steal code licensed under the
Apache 2.0, MIT or BSD licenses and lock it down under the GPL in their derivative projects.

The TFL was created to keep code free. Free as in freedom.  Free as in you're free to ship commerical
products using this code.  Free as in you're free to add your own ideas and not share them with the
workd (if you think they are bad or simply don't want to.)

And of course, as we've seen with the Open Source movement, freedom begets freedom.  Those who are free
to use code tend to do so, and they tend to contribute the code back to the community. 

All this without the animosity nor the ideological witch hunts that the GPL has spawned.

The TFL is quite literally the anti-GPL.  It is a liberal license with the restriction that no code
released under the TFL may be stolen and released under the GPL.  That's it.

While there is little, short of taking people to court, that we can do to prevent these people from
stealing other's work, and locking it away, never to give anything back, we can at least make it clear
that this is what they are doing.

And thus, we have the Truly Free License.
