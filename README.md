_The Truly Free License_

### Why?

The past 20 years have seen a wonderful evolution of the open source community. Despite the early popularity
of the GPL, open source has come into being and a number of free licenses have become widely used.   No longer
is our opportunity to cooperate to make software better held ransom under the terms of the GPL, naively chosen
by those who thought it was "the open source license".

However, given that the FSF is more of an ideological movement than a software movement, it has produced
a large contingent of people who do not actually understand the terms of these licenses.  Since they think
that all software should be "free as in pwned by Stallman", they often take software licensed under
liberal licenses and re-license it under the GPL.

Worse, many of them think that this is allowed under the terms of more free licenses, and claim publicly
that they're free to incorporate Apache 2.0 or MIT or BSD licensed code in their GPL projects!

While there is little, short of taking people to court, that we can do to prevent these people from
stealing other's work, we can at least make it clear that this is what they are doing.

And thus, we have the Truly Free License.
