_The Truly Free License_

### Why?

The past 20 years have seen a wonderful evolution of the open source community. Despite early setbacks
from the Forces of Software Fascism (FSF for short), open source has come into being and a number of
free licenses have become widely used.   No longer is our opportunity to cooperate to make software 
better held ransom under the terms of the GPL, naively chosen by those who thought it was "the open
source license".

However, given that the FSF is more of an ideological movement than a software movement, it has produced
a large contingent of people who do not actually understand the terms of these licenses.  Since they think 
that all software should be "free as in fascism", they often take software licensed under liberal licenses 
and re-license it under the GPL!

Worse, many of them think that this is allowed under the more free licenses, and claim publically that
they're free to incorporate Apache 2.0 or MIT or BSD licensed code in their GPL projects!

While there is little, short of taking people to court, that we can do to prevent these people from
stealing our work, and locking it away, never to give anything back, we can at least make it clear
that this is what they are doing.

And thus, we have the Truly Free License. 

### Where?

The license is contained in the file LICENSE.md.  Please create issues if you have feedback,
or pull requests if you have improvements.

The plan is to revise the license and keep it at 0.x until the summer of 2013, where it will
be blessed as 1.0. 

So, if anyone actually does read this, and has an opinion, now's the time to share!

### Who?
